## java-imdb-parser
This code implements a program that searches for common movies for two actors based on their surnames. 
The program asks the user for the surnames of two actors and then finds the movies in which they both starred. 
The program uses the [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) website and the [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) and [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/) libraries to search for movies.
